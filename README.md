## Features

- **Spring Security 6**: Craft a fortified backend by leveraging the latest capabilities of Spring Security 6. Ensure that your application's data remains safeguarded with top-tier security measures..

- **Spring Data JPA**: Seamlessly interact with your database through Spring Data JPA. Manage user data, roles, and more with the power of JPA-based repositories.

- **JWT Generation**: Elevate security to the next level with JSON Web Token (JWT) generation. Ensure secure communication between your frontend and backend while minimizing potential vulnerabilities.

- **HTTP POST Capabilities**: Harness the power of HTTP POST requests to create, update, and manage resources. Empower your frontend to interact seamlessly with the backend..
