## Introduction

In today's digital landscape, security is of paramount importance. This project aims to provide 
a comprehensive example of building a secure web application using Java and the MVC architectural pattern. 
By implementing best practices for security, the project ensures the protection of user data, authentication, authorization, and more.

## Features

- User registration and authentication
- Role-based access control
- Password hashing and encryption
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) prevention
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection
- Secure session management
- Input validation and sanitation
- Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Secure communication over HTTPS.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17
- Apache Maven
- Database system (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- Web server (Apache Tomcat, etc.)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mvc-security-java.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd mvc-security-java
   ```

3. Build the project using Maven:
   ```sh
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. Configure the database settings in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.

5. Deploy the application on a web server.

## Usage

Once the project is deployed and running, you can access the web application through your browser. 
Follow the provided URLs to register, log in, and explore the secure features. Refer to the source 
code and documentation for insights into how different security measures are implemented.

## Security Measures

This project emphasizes the implementation of various security measures:

- **Authentication**: Secure user registration and login mechanisms.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control for different user privileges.
- **Password Security**: Passwords are securely hashed and stored in the database.
- **XSS Prevention**: User input is sanitized to prevent cross-site scripting attacks.
- **CSRF Protection**: Tokens are used to prevent cross-site request forgery.
- **Secure Session Management**: User sessions are managed securely to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Input Validation**: User input is validated and sanitized to prevent code injection.
- **2FA**: Implementation of two-factor authentication for enhanced security.
- **HTTPS**: Secure communication is ensured using HTTPS.
